  "abstract": "Come learn how OrangeX in Spain is transforming enterprise networks with AWS Cloud and Nokia's Nuage SD-WAN. Nuage's SD-WAN is delivered with management, control, and user plane in the AWS cloud. It is powered by Amazon EC2 i3.metal and AWS hybrid IT services via true multi-tenant, built-in multi-segment orchestrators, and multi-tier management spanning from operators to partners to direct enterprise portals. This enables the solution to be extended directly to service provider private backbones and cloud data centers and services, as well as between enterprise sites. The solution further enables SD-WAN over last mile broadband and leased wholesale circuits to access existing private backbones to leverage their reliable mid-mile connectivity and existing connectivity to enterprise sites. With SD-WAN becoming an essential function in vCPE deployments, Nuage’s SD-WAN has been established as the platform for simplifying the delivery and deployment of virtual network functions, such as security and agility, on-premises, and in the cloud. Learn factors to consider in using SD-WAN solution with AWS, agile implementation of the solution, and leveraging a cloud-ready operating model. We share sufficient references for you to take away to continue learning.",

It applies to a diverse number of use cases, from web applications and APIs to data processing applications. Although serverless computing and AWS Lambda have changed how application development is done, the Twelve-Factor best practices remain relevant and applicable in a serverless world. You'll learn how to directly apply the Twelve-Factor methodology to serverless application development with Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. As you’ll see, many of these factors are not only directly applicable to serverless applications, but in fact a default mechanism or capability of the AWS serverless platform. ",

Should you move your application to a similar infrastructure in the cloud (in a lift-and-shift scenario)? Or should you refactor your application to take advantage of cloud-native services for object storage, serverless, auto-scaling, and so on? In this session, an AWS expert walks through the ten commandments that enterprises should follow when moving applications to the cloud and refactoring them for optimal performance. Then, a representative of Sysco Corporation, a Fortune 50 company, shares how the company migrated mission-critical legacy business systems and modernized them to take advantage of the AWS Cloud. Learn how the company moved its enterprise purchasing system, which processes millions of dollars in sales daily, to the AWS Cloud while achieving a 60% decrease in run costs. Also discover the lessons learned and highlights of the migration, which resulted in 30% increase in performance, 3x improvement in user accessibility, and a significant decrease in order backlogs and outages.",

Expectations from regulators for PCI DSS-compliant workloads have evolved with increased focus on risk reduction, transparency, and standardization. In this space, the need to replace legacy systems, address security concerns, and support a highly seasonal 24/7/365 operation present barriers to innovation. In this chalk talk, we examine how our customers address these concerns by using the AWS Cloud to rapidly build their own scalable payment systems, leveraging PCI DSS-compliant AWS services across compute, database, analytics, and security. Together, we explore traditional design patterns based on our PCI DSS Quick Start, as well as the evolution to managed services, microservices, and serverless services.",

In this session, Mendez-Costabel discusses how Bayer transitioned from on-premises packaged software architecture to open-source software and cloud services from AWS to build a modern, scalable, high-performance, open-source app on AWS. Learn about the open-source application architecture and AWS services used. Learn how the computing environment has changed the way that Bayer is performing R&D projects, and how the move to a modern architecture has enabled Bayer’s customers to gain insights that are transforming their businesses.",

Nuage's SD-WAN is delivered with management, control, and user plane in the AWS cloud. It is powered by Amazon EC2 i3.metal and AWS hybrid IT services via true multi-tenant, built-in multi-segment orchestrators, and multi-tier management spanning from operators to partners to direct enterprise portals. This enables the solution to be extended directly to service provider private backbones and cloud data centers and services, as well as between enterprise sites. The solution further enables SD-WAN over last mile broadband and leased wholesale circuits to access existing private backbones to leverage their reliable mid-mile connectivity and existing connectivity to enterprise sites. With SD-WAN becoming an essential function in vCPE deployments, Nuage’s SD-WAN has been established as the platform for simplifying the delivery and deployment of virtual network functions, such as security and agility, on-premises, and in the cloud. Learn factors to consider in using SD-WAN solution with AWS, agile implementation of the solution, and leveraging a cloud-ready operating model.

To gain the most valuable insights, they must use this data immediately so they can react quickly to new information. In this workshop, you will learn how to take advantage of streaming data sources to analyze and react in near real time. We provide several requirements for a real-world streaming data scenario, and you're tasked with creating a solution that successfully satisfies the requirements using services such as Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS.",
